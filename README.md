## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Web-first workflow

### What I learned

In my previous two challenges of FrontEnd mentor, I was using flexbox and margin to centre the component but in this project I was able to try out the 'Grid' style to centre the component. I will definitely be learning more about it.

### Continued development

 - I want to be learn more responsive design because I'm having some challenges but in the future projects I'm confident there will be improvement.

 - I would also love to learn more about CSS Grid and flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me with the grid css trick and I recommend it to anyone trying to be perfect at CSS. They have everything you will ever need.
